# TakeItEsee Mobile API Readiness

## Phase 1 — Authentication foundation

Native Android and iOS clients authenticate with Supabase and send the Supabase access token to TakeItEsee API routes as:

`Authorization: Bearer <access-token>`

The server validates that JWT with Supabase, then re-derives platform roles from server-owned records. Browser cookie authentication remains supported and unchanged.

### Native session handshake

`GET /api/mobile/session`

Authenticated response:

```json
{
  "authenticated": true,
  "user_id": "<uuid>",
  "roles": ["customer"]
}
```

Provider accounts continue to resolve their server-owned Professional or Business role in addition to Customer. The endpoint does not return access tokens, refresh tokens, passwords, or profile secrets.

## Next mobile-readiness slices

1. Customer requirements API bearer propagation.
2. Marketplace search/public provider contracts.
3. Provider requirement leads and proposal actions.
4. Customer/provider booking API bearer propagation.
5. Notifications and messages.
6. Service completion and reviews.
7. Final native contract freeze before React Native + Expo application work.

## Frozen boundaries

Finance/Cashfree/payment/refund/payout/settlement/reconciliation/recovery remain HOLD. Recurrence/recovery remains FROZEN. `RequirementOccurrenceRecoveryPanel.tsx` remains untouched.
